# 🚀 TDD Pipeline - AGGRESSIVE SETTINGS ACTIVATED

## ⚡ Current Configuration

### Speed Settings
| Setting | Conservative | **AGGRESSIVE** | Impact |
|---------|-------------|----------------|--------|
| Tests per run | 3 | **5** | 67% more tests per batch |
| Runs per day | 5 | **10** | 2x more frequent |
| Cooldown | 30 min | **15 min** | 2x faster turnaround |
| Timeout | 60 min | **90 min** | Handle complex tests |
| Schedule | Disabled | **Every 4 hours** | 24/7 operation |
| Rollout phase | testing | **full** | All features enabled |

### Throughput Metrics
- **Manual triggers**: 10 runs/day × 5 tests = **50 tests/day**
- **Scheduled runs**: 6 runs/day × 5 tests = **30 tests/day** (additional)
- **Combined maximum**: **80 tests/day** (if all runs succeed)
- **Realistic estimate**: **50 tests/day** (60-70% efficiency)

## 📊 Timeline Projections

With **801 tests** to fix:

| Scenario | Tests/Day | Timeline | Completion Date |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| Maximum (100%) | 80 | **10 days** | Early November |
| Realistic (65%) | 50 | **16 days** | Mid November |
| Conservative (50%) | 40 | **20 days** | Late November |
| With failures (40%) | 32 | **25 days** | Early December |

## 💰 Cost Implications

### Daily Costs
- **API calls**: ~50 tests × $0.50-1.00 = **$25-50/day**
- **Monthly projection**: **$750-1500**
- **Budget limit**: $100/day (configured)
- **Alert threshold**: $80/day (80%)

### Total Project Cost
- **16-day timeline**: **$400-800**
- **25-day timeline**: **$625-1250**
- Compare to manual: $32,000+ (developer time)

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigations

### Risks
1. **Higher failure rate** - More complex debugging with parallel operations
2. **API quota limits** - May hit Claude Code rate limits
3. **Merge conflicts** - More frequent PRs increase conflict probability
4. **Quality issues** - Less time for thorough validation

### Mitigations
- ✅ Concurrency group prevents parallel conflicts
- ✅ Automatic rollback on test failures
- ✅ Human review still required for all PRs
- ✅ Rate limiting still enforced (10 runs/day max)
- ✅ Monitoring dashboard tracks success rates

## 🎯 Optimization Tips

### Week 1 - Ramp Up
- Monitor first 2-3 automated runs closely
- Check PR quality and test coverage
- Adjust if failure rate >30%

### Week 2-3 - Full Speed
- Let scheduled runs operate 24/7
- Review PRs in batches (morning/evening)
- Focus on merge conflicts resolution

### Success Metrics to Track
- **Success rate**: Target >65%
- **Tests per PR**: Should average 4-5
- **Time to merge**: Target <4 hours
- **Rollback rate**: Should be <10%

## 🔧 Quick Commands

### Monitor Pipeline
```bash
# Check running workflows
gh run list --workflow=tdd-auto-fix.yml --limit 5

# View pipeline metrics
cat .github/tdd-metrics.json | jq '.summary'

# Check progress
bun run scripts/tdd-automation/track-progress.ts
```

### Adjust Settings
```bash
# If too aggressive, reduce to moderate
# Edit .github/tdd-automation-config.yml:
# - max_tests_per_run: 4
# - max_daily_runs: 7
# - cooldown_minutes: 20
```

### Emergency Stop
```bash
# Disable pipeline completely
# Edit .github/tdd-automation-config.yml:
# pipeline.enabled: false

# Or disable just scheduled runs:
# schedule.enabled: false
```

## ✅ Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** these aggressive settings
2. **Monitor first run** via GitHub Actions
3. **Review first PR** for quality
4. **Adjust if needed** based on results

**Remember**: You can always dial back settings if the pace is too aggressive. Start with a day of monitoring before leaving it to run unattended.
