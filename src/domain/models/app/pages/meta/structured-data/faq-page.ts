/**
 * Schema.org FAQPage structured data
 *
 * Represents a Frequently Asked Questions page with a list of question-answer pairs.
 * Enables expandable Q&A rich results in Google search, dramatically increasing
 * visibility and click-through rates.
 *
 * Required properties:
 * - @context: "https://schema.org" (Schema.org vocabulary)
 * - @type: "FAQPage" (Schema.org type identifier)
 * - mainEntity: Array of Question objects (each with name and acceptedAnswer)
 *
 * Question structure:
 * - Each question has @type "Question", name (question text), acceptedAnswer
 * - Each acceptedAnswer has @type "Answer", text (answer content)
 * - Questions can include HTML in answer text for formatting (lists, bold, links)
 *
 * Best practices:
 * - **5-10 questions**: Optimal number for comprehensive FAQ
 * - **Concise questions**: Clear, direct questions users would ask
 * - **Detailed answers**: Complete answers that satisfy user intent
 * - **Natural language**: Write questions as users would ask them
 * - **Avoid promotional content**: Focus on answering questions, not selling
 *
 * SEO impact:
 * - **Rich results**: Expandable Q&A boxes in Google search results
 * - **SERP visibility**: Takes up more screen space (higher CTR)
 * - **Answer surfacing**: Users see answers without clicking through
 * - **Featured snippets**: FAQ answers can appear in featured snippets
 * - **Voice search**: Answers optimized for voice search queries
 * - **Support reduction**: Answers in search reduce support ticket volume
 *
 * Google display:
 * - Questions appear as expandable boxes in search results
 * - Users can expand/collapse answers directly in search
 * - Clicking question takes user to FAQ page with answer highlighted
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const faqPage = {
 *   "@context": "https://schema.org",
 *   "@type": "FAQPage",
 *   mainEntity: [
 *     {
 *       "@type": "Question",
 *       name: "What is the refund policy?",
 *       acceptedAnswer: {
 *         "@type": "Answer",
 *         text: "We offer a 30-day money-back guarantee on all purchases."
 *       }
 *     },
 *     {
 *       "@type": "Question",
 *       name: "How long does shipping take?",
 *       acceptedAnswer: {
 *         "@type": "Answer",
 *         text: "Standard shipping takes 5-7 business days. Express shipping takes 2-3 business days."
 *       }
 *     }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
