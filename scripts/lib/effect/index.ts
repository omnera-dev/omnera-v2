/**
 * Effect Services for Scripts
 *
 * This module exports all Effect services used across the scripts/ directory.
 * These services provide consistent, composable, and testable abstractions for:
 * - File system operations (FileSystemService)
 * - Command execution (CommandService)
 * - Validation logic (ValidationService)
 * - Structured logging (LoggerService)
 *
 * Usage:
 * ```typescript
 * import { FileSystemService, CommandService } from '@/scripts/lib/effect'
 * import * as Effect from 'effect/Effect'
 * import * as Layer from 'effect/Layer'
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const fs = yield* FileSystemService
 *   const cmd = yield* CommandService
 *
 *   const content = yield* fs.readFile('package.json')
 *   const result = yield* cmd.spawn(['bun', 'test'])
 *
 *   return { content, result }
 * })
 *
 * const mainLayer = Layer.mergeAll(
 *   FileSystemServiceLive,
 *   CommandServiceLive,
 *   LoggerServiceLive()
 * )
 *
 * Effect.runPromise(program.pipe(Effect.provide(mainLayer)))
 * ```
