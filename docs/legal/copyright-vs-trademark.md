## Common Questions

### Q: Should copyright say "Omnera" instead of "ESSENTIAL SERVICES"?

**A: No!** Copyright must belong to a legal entity (your company), not a product name.

### Q: Can I use "Omnera™" everywhere?

**A: Yes!** Use the ™ symbol to indicate it's your trademark. Once registration is complete, you can use ®.

### Q: What if someone creates "Omnera Plus" or "Omnera Cloud"?

**A:** Your trademark registration allows you to prevent this (in France initially, potentially other jurisdictions). See TRADEMARK.md for details.

### Q: Can I sell the software under a different name?

**A:** Yes! You could license the code to someone who rebrands it (like how WordPress is rebranded by many hosting companies). Your trademark prevents them from using "Omnera" without permission.

## Trademark Symbol Usage

| Symbol | Meaning              | When to Use                                             |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| ™     | Trademark claim      | While registration is pending or for unregistered marks |
| ®     | Registered trademark | Only AFTER official registration is complete            |
| ©     | Copyright            | For creative works (code, documentation)                |

**Current recommendation**: Use ™ for Omnera until registration is fully complete, then switch to ®.
