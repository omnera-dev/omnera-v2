# Testing Strategy - E2E-First TDD with Test-After Unit Tests

> **Note**: This is part 11 of the split documentation. See navigation links below.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### E2E Tests (Written FIRST - TDD)

- ❌ Implementing features without E2E tests first
- ❌ Testing every edge case in E2E (use unit tests for edge cases)
- ❌ Relying on test execution order
- ❌ Using real-time data or live APIs (mock external dependencies)
- ❌ Manual screenshot comparison instead of assertions
- ❌ Tests that only pass on developer's machine
- ❌ Writing E2E tests after feature is complete (defeats purpose of TDD)
- ❌ Vague E2E tests that don't clearly define feature completion

### Unit Tests (Written AFTER - Test-After)

- ❌ Testing implementation details instead of behavior
- ❌ Shared mutable state between tests
- ❌ Tests depending on execution order
- ❌ Actual network calls or database queries
- ❌ Manual verification of console output
- ❌ Skipping unit tests after implementation ("we have E2E tests, that's enough")
- ❌ Writing unit tests before understanding actual implementation (premature)
- ❌ Incomplete edge case coverage (unit tests should be comprehensive)
