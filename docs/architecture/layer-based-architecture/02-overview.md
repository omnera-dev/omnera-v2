# Layer-Based Architecture in Omnera

> **Note**: This is part 2 of the split documentation. See navigation links below.


## Overview
Omnera follows a **Layer-Based Architecture** (also known as **Layered Architecture**), a proven architectural pattern that organizes code into distinct horizontal layers with well-defined responsibilities and clear boundaries. Each layer has a specific role and communicates with other layers through explicit interfaces.
This architecture pattern aligns perfectly with Omnera's Functional Programming principles and Effect.ts's dependency injection system, creating a maintainable, testable, and scalable codebase.
