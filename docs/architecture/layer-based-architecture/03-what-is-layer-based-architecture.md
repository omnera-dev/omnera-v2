## What is Layer-Based Architecture?

Layer-Based Architecture structures an application into logical layers stacked on top of each other. Each layer:

- Has a single, well-defined responsibility
- Communicates only with adjacent layers (typically)
- Depends on layers below it, never above
- Provides clear interfaces for interaction
- Can be developed, tested, and maintained independently
