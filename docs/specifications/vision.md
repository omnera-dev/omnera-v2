# Omnera Vision & Mission

> **⚠️ Vision Document**: This document describes the **purpose, vision, and target state** for Omnera. Most features described here are **not yet implemented**. For current capabilities, see [ROADMAP.md](../../ROADMAP.md).

---

## Mission Statement

**To make every organization sovereign in their information systems—free from SaaS lock-in, in complete control of their data, and empowered to build business applications through simple JSON configuration.**

---

## The Problem: SaaS Dependency Crisis

Modern organizations are drowning in technological dependencies:

### The Cost of Fragmentation

- **20+ SaaS subscriptions** per company on average
- **$10,000+/month** in recurring fees for mid-sized teams
- **Data scattered** across incompatible platforms (Airtable, Notion, Retool, Zapier, Webflow)
- **Vendor lock-in** preventing migration or customization
- **Privacy concerns** with data stored on third-party servers

### The Hidden Costs

1. **Loss of Sovereignty**: Your business logic lives in someone else's platform
2. **Compounding Expenses**: Per-user pricing scales exponentially with growth
3. **Feature Dependency**: Can't build what you need—only what vendors provide
4. **Engineering Distraction**: Teams waste time integrating incompatible tools
5. **Strategic Risk**: Business continuity depends on external companies

### The Paradox

No-code tools promised to make software development accessible, but instead created **a new form of dependency**:

- You escape coding complexity but gain **vendor complexity**
- You avoid infrastructure but lose **control and ownership**
- You get quick setup but face **long-term lock-in**

---

## The Solution: Omnera

**Omnera breaks the SaaS dependency cycle** by providing a **self-hosted, configuration-driven platform** that puts organizations back in control.

### What Omnera Does

Omnera is a **source-available runtime** that interprets JSON configuration files to build and serve full-featured web applications—without code generation, without vendor lock-in, without loss of control.

```typescript
// Your entire business application in one JSON file
{
  "name": "Company CRM",
  "tables": [ /* your data structures */ ],
  "pages": [ /* your web interfaces */ ],
  "automations": [ /* your workflows */ ],
  "connections": [ /* your integrations */ ]
}
```

**One command to run:**

```bash
bun run omnera start config.json
```

**Result**: A complete web application with database, authentication, API, and UI—running on your infrastructure, under your control.

### How It Works

```
JSON Configuration → Omnera Runtime → Live Application
     (Your business logic)  (Our engine)    (Your infrastructure)
```

1. **You write**: JSON configuration describing your business needs
2. **Omnera interprets**: Configuration at runtime (no code generation)
3. **You own**: Full application running on your servers
4. **You control**: Data, features, deployment, everything

---

## Core Principles: Why We Build Omnera This Way

### 1. **Digital Sovereignty**

Organizations should **own** their information systems, not **rent** them.

- **Your data** lives on your infrastructure
- **Your features** defined by your business needs
- **Your control** over deployment, security, and access
- **Your independence** from vendor decisions

### 2. **Configuration Over Coding**

Business applications should be **configured**, not **programmed**.

- **JSON/TypeScript** instead of visual drag-and-drop
- **Version control** (Git) for all configuration
- **Type safety** with compile-time validation
- **Reusable templates** as organizational knowledge

### 3. **Minimal Dependencies**

Reduce technical dependencies to **only essential infrastructure**.

- **Depend on**: Commodity compute (AWS/Vercel) + storage (PostgreSQL/S3)
- **Don't depend on**: Proprietary SaaS platforms, vendor APIs, closed ecosystems
- **Source-available**: Audit, modify, extend the platform yourself
- **Self-hosted**: No external service calls, no vendor outages

### 4. **Business Focus**

Engineering teams should focus on **business logic**, not **infrastructure complexity**.

- **No DevOps overhead**: Omnera handles server, database, auth, APIs
- **No integration hell**: One platform, one configuration, one deployment
- **No vendor research**: Stop evaluating SaaS tools, start building
- **Instant iteration**: Change configuration, refresh browser, done

### 5. **Configuration Reusability**

JSON templates become **organizational assets** that accelerate development.

```typescript
// Base template: CRM
const crmTemplate = { /* customer management logic */ }

// Reuse for different departments
const salesCRM = { ...crmTemplate, customFields: [...] }
const supportCRM = { ...crmTemplate, workflows: [...] }
const partnerCRM = { ...crmTemplate, permissions: [...] }

// Build 3 applications in minutes, not months
```

**Templates evolve with your organization**, capturing institutional knowledge in version-controlled code.

## What Omnera Is (and Isn't)

### ✅ Omnera IS

- **Alternative to**: Airtable, Retool, Notion, Webflow, Zapier (self-hosted, config-driven)
- **Installation**: Bun package (`npm install omnera`)
- **Deployment**: Your infrastructure (AWS, Vercel, Docker, bare metal)
- **Configuration**: JSON/TypeScript files (version-controlled)
- **Source**: Source-available, fair-code model
- **Target users**: Developers, DevOps teams, technical organizations
- **Best for**: Internal tools, customer portals, business applications, APIs

### ❌ Omnera IS NOT
