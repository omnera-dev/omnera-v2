# Description

> **Status**: ✅ DONE
> **Completion**: 50%
> **Complexity**: 5 points

A comprehensive description of your application's purpose, features, and intended use. This description helps users understand what the application does and appears in application listings, documentation, and metadata. Use clear, concise language that explains the business value.

## Implementation Status

**Schema**: ✅ Implemented (`src/domain/models/app/description.ts`)

**Tests**: ✅ All tests GREEN (16 passing)

✅ **Fully Implemented**

## Effect Schema Blueprint

> **For**: `schema-architect` agent

The following Effect Schema definition should be implemented in `src/domain/models/app/`.

### Description Schema

**Location**: `src/domain/models/app/description.ts`

**Imports**:

```typescript
import { Schema } from 'effect'
```

**Implementation**:

````typescript
/**
 * Application Description
 *
 * A comprehensive description of your application's purpose, features, and intended use. This description helps users understand what the application does and appears in application listings, documentation, and metadata. Use clear, concise language that explains the business value.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * "A customer relationship management system for tracking sales leads and opportunities"
 * ```
 */
export const DescriptionSchema = Schema.String.pipe(
  Schema.minLength(1, { message: () => 'This field is required' }),
  Schema.annotations({
    title: 'Application Description',
    description:
      "A comprehensive description of your application's purpose, features, and intended use. This description helps users understand what the application does and appears in application listings, documentation, and metadata. Use clear, concise language that explains the business value.",
    examples: [
      'A customer relationship management system for tracking sales leads and opportunities',
      'Internal inventory management platform with automated reordering workflows',
      'Project management tool for agile teams with sprint planning and kanban boards',
      'Employee onboarding portal with document management and task tracking',
    ],
  })
)

export type Description = Schema.Schema.Type<typeof DescriptionSchema>

## E2E Test Scenarios

> **For**: `e2e-red-test-writer` agent

The following user stories should be implemented as Playwright tests in `tests/app/`.

**Test File**: `tests/app/description.spec.ts`

### @spec User Stories (Granular Behaviors)

These tests define specific acceptance criteria. Each test validates ONE behavior.

**Scenario 1**: Validation Test

- **GIVEN**: user enters Description
- **WHEN**: input length is less than 1 characters
- **THEN**: display error "Minimum length is 1 characters"
- **Tag**: `@spec`

### @regression User Story (Complete Workflow)

This test consolidates ALL @spec tests into ONE comprehensive workflow.

**Complete Configuration Workflow**:

- **GIVEN**: user is configuring Description in the application
- **WHEN**: user completes full configuration workflow including all fields and validations
- **THEN**: configuration is saved successfully with all validations passing and data persists correctly
- **Tag**: `@regression`

### data-testid Patterns

Use these standardized test IDs for reliable selectors:

- `[data-testid="description-input"]`
- `[data-testid="description-error"]`
