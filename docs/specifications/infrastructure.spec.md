# Infrastructure Specification

This document contains user stories for infrastructure features. These stories are used by the `e2e-test-translator` agent to generate E2E tests in `tests/infrastructure/`.

## Overview

Infrastructure features provide the foundational services that power the application:

- **Authentication** - Better Auth integration for sign-up, sign-in, sessions
- **Server** - Hono server with health checks, error handling, asset serving
- **Database** - Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL

## Authentication (Better Auth)

### Sign-Up

**GIVEN** the application is running **WHEN** I send a POST request to `/api/auth/sign-up/email` with valid user data (email, password, name) **THEN** a new user should be created in the database

**GIVEN** I have signed up **WHEN** I check the database **THEN** I should see a user record with my email and hashed password

**GIVEN** I have signed up **WHEN** I check my session **THEN** I should have an active session

**GIVEN** I try to sign up **WHEN** I use an email that already exists **THEN** I should receive a validation error indicating the email is already registered

**GIVEN** I try to sign up **WHEN** I submit invalid data (missing email, weak password) **THEN** I should receive appropriate validation errors

### Sign-In

**GIVEN** I have an existing account **WHEN** I send a POST request to `/api/auth/sign-in/email` with correct credentials **THEN** I should receive a session token

**GIVEN** I have signed in **WHEN** I check the database **THEN** I should see an active session record

**GIVEN** I try to sign in **WHEN** I use incorrect credentials **THEN** I should receive an authentication error

**GIVEN** I try to sign in **WHEN** I use a non-existent email **THEN** I should receive an authentication error

### Session Management

**GIVEN** I have an active session **WHEN** I send a GET request to `/api/auth/session` **THEN** I should receive my session data (user info, session token)

**GIVEN** I am not signed in **WHEN** I send a GET request to `/api/auth/session` **THEN** I should receive null or an unauthenticated response

**GIVEN** I have an active session **WHEN** I send a POST request to `/api/auth/sign-out` **THEN** my session should be invalidated

**GIVEN** I have signed out **WHEN** I send a GET request to `/api/auth/session` **THEN** I should receive null or an unauthenticated response

### Database Persistence

**GIVEN** I sign in and sign out multiple times **WHEN** I sign in again with the same credentials **THEN** I should be able to authenticate successfully

**GIVEN** I have created an account **WHEN** the server restarts **THEN** my user data should persist in the database

## Server Infrastructure

### Health Endpoint

**GIVEN** the server is running **WHEN** I send a GET request to `/health` **THEN** I should receive a 200 OK status

**GIVEN** I request the health endpoint **WHEN** the response is received **THEN** it should contain JSON with status, timestamp, and app name

**GIVEN** I request the health endpoint **WHEN** the response is received **THEN** the content-type should be application/json

### CSS Compilation (Tailwind)

**GIVEN** the server is running **WHEN** I send a GET request to `/output.css` **THEN** I should receive compiled Tailwind CSS

**GIVEN** I request `/output.css` **WHEN** the response is received **THEN** it should have cache-control headers set to 1 hour (3600 seconds)

**GIVEN** I request `/output.css` **WHEN** the response is received **THEN** the content-type should be text/css

### Homepage

**GIVEN** the server is running with an app configuration **WHEN** I navigate to `/` **THEN** the homepage should render with the app name

**GIVEN** the homepage loads **WHEN** I view the HTML **THEN** it should have proper structure (doctype, html, head, body tags)

**GIVEN** the homepage loads **WHEN** I view the page **THEN** it should include the app name, description, and version (if configured)

### Error Handling

**GIVEN** the server is running **WHEN** I navigate to a non-existent route (e.g., `/this-page-does-not-exist`) **THEN** I should see a 404 Not Found page

**GIVEN** I see a 404 page **WHEN** I view the page **THEN** it should have a user-friendly error message

**GIVEN** a server error occurs **WHEN** the error is caught by the error handler **THEN** I should see a 500 Internal Server Error page

**GIVEN** I see a 500 page **WHEN** I view the page **THEN** it should have a user-friendly error message without exposing sensitive details

## Database (Drizzle ORM)

### Schema Management

**GIVEN** the database schema is defined **WHEN** migrations are applied **THEN** all tables should be created correctly (users, sessions, accounts, verifications)

**GIVEN** the database is initialized **WHEN** I query the schema **THEN** all foreign key constraints should be enforced

### Connection Management

**GIVEN** the application starts **WHEN** the database connection is established **THEN** the application should be able to execute queries

**GIVEN** the database is unavailable **WHEN** the application tries to connect **THEN** it should handle the connection error gracefully

## Future Infrastructure Features

The following sections are placeholders for future infrastructure features:

### Caching

- Redis integration
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Cache warming

### Monitoring

- Application metrics
- Performance monitoring
- Error tracking

### Background Jobs

- Job queue setup
- Scheduled tasks
- Retry policies

**Note**: This is a living document. User stories should follow the GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format and be specific, testable, and focused on infrastructure behavior and integration points.
