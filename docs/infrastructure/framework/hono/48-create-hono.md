# Create-hono

Command-line options supported by `create-hono` - the project initializer that runs when you run `npm create hono@latest`, `npx create-hono@latest`, or `pnpm create hono@latest`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Why this page?** The installation / quick-start examples often show a minimal `npm create hono@latest my-app` command. `create-hono` supports several useful flags you can pass to automate and customize project creation (select templates, skip prompts, pick a package manager, use local cache, and more).

## Passing arguments:

When you use `npm create` (or `npx`) arguments intended for the initializer script must be placed **after** `--`. Anything after `--` is forwarded to the initializer.
