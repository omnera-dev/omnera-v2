description: The organization plugin allows you to manage your organization's members and teams.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Organizations simplifies user access and permissions management. Assign roles and permissions to streamline project management, team coordination, and partnerships.

## Installation

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Add the plugin to your **auth** config

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
            organization() // [!code highlight]
        ] // [!code highlight]
    })
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Migrate the database

    Run the migration or generate the schema to add the necessary fields and tables to the database.

    <Tabs items={["migrate", "generate"]}>
      <Tab value="migrate">
        ```bash
        npx @better-auth/cli migrate
        ```
      </Tab>

      <Tab value="generate">
        ```bash
        npx @better-auth/cli generate
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    See the [Schema](#schema) section to add the fields manually.
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Add the client plugin

    ```ts title="auth-client.ts"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
            organizationClient() // [!code highlight]
        ] // [!code highlight]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Usage

Once you've installed the plugin, you can start using the organization plugin to manage your organization's members and teams. The client plugin will provide you with methods under the `organization` namespace, and the server `api` will provide you with the necessary endpoints to manage your organization and give you an easier way to call the functions on your own backend.

## Organization

### Create an organization

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.create({
    name: My Organization,
    slug: my-org,
    logo: https://example.com/logo.png, // required
    metadata, // required
    userId: some_user_id, // required
    keepCurrentActiveOrganization, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.createOrganization({
    body: {
        name: My Organization,
        slug: my-org,
        logo: https://example.com/logo.png, // required
        metadata, // required
        userId: some_user_id, // required
        keepCurrentActiveOrganization, // required
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type createOrganization = {
  /**
  * The organization name.
  */
  name: string = "My Organization"
  /**
  * The organization slug.
  */
  slug: string = "my-org"
  /**
  * The organization logo.
  */
  logo?: string = "https://example.com/logo.png"
  /**
  * The metadata of the organization.
  */
  metadata?: Record<string, any>
  /**
  * The user ID of the organization creator. If not provided, the current user will be used. Should only be used by admins or when called by the server.
  * @serverOnly
  */
  userId?: string = "some_user_id"
  /**
  * Whether to keep the current active organization active after creating a new one.
  */
  keepCurrentActiveOrganization?: boolean = false

}
```

#### Restrict who can create an organization

By default, any user can create an organization. To restrict this, set the `allowUserToCreateOrganization` option to a function that returns a boolean, or directly to `true` or `false`.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";

const auth = betterAuth({
  //...
  plugins: [
    organization({
      allowUserToCreateOrganization: async (user) => {
        // [!code highlight]
        const subscription = await getSubscription(user.id); // [!code highlight]
        return subscription.plan === "pro"; // [!code highlight]
      }, // [!code highlight]
    }),
  ],
});
```

#### Check if organization slug is taken

To check if an organization slug is taken or not you can use the `checkSlug` function provided by the client. The function takes an object with the following properties:

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.checkSlug({
    slug: my-org,
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.checkOrganizationSlug({
    body: {
        slug: my-org,
    }
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type checkOrganizationSlug = {
    /**
     * The organization slug to check.
     */
    slug: string = "my-org"

}
```

### Organization Hooks

You can customize organization operations using hooks that run before and after various organization-related activities. Better Auth provides two ways to configure hooks:

1. **Legacy organizationCreation hooks** (deprecated, use `organizationHooks` instead)
2. **Modern organizationHooks** (recommended) - provides comprehensive control over all organization-related activities

#### Organization Creation and Management Hooks

Control organization lifecycle operations:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      organizationHooks: {
        // Organization creation hooks
        beforeCreateOrganization: async ({ organization, user }) => {
          // Run custom logic before organization is created
          // Optionally modify the organization data
          return {
            data: {
              ...organization,
              metadata: {
                customField: "value",
              },
            },
          };
        },

        afterCreateOrganization: async ({ organization, member, user }) => {
          // Run custom logic after organization is created
          // e.g., create default resources, send notifications
          await setupDefaultResources(organization.id);
        },

        // Organization update hooks
        beforeUpdateOrganization: async ({ organization, user, member }) => {
          // Validate updates, apply business rules
          return {
            data: {
              ...organization,
              name: organization.name?.toLowerCase(),
            },
          };
        },

        afterUpdateOrganization: async ({ organization, user, member }) => {
          // Sync changes to external systems
          await syncOrganizationToExternalSystems(organization);
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

<Callout type="info">
  The legacy `organizationCreation` hooks are still supported but deprecated.
  Use `organizationHooks.beforeCreateOrganization` and
  `organizationHooks.afterCreateOrganization` instead for new projects.
</Callout>

#### Member Hooks

Control member operations within organizations:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      organizationHooks: {
        // Before a member is added to an organization
        beforeAddMember: async ({ member, user, organization }) => {
          // Custom validation or modification
          console.log(`Adding ${user.email} to ${organization.name}`);

          // Optionally modify member data
          return {
            data: {
              ...member,
              role: "custom-role", // Override the role
            },
          };
        },

        // After a member is added
        afterAddMember: async ({ member, user, organization }) => {
          // Send welcome email, create default resources, etc.
          await sendWelcomeEmail(user.email, organization.name);
        },

        // Before a member is removed
        beforeRemoveMember: async ({ member, user, organization }) => {
          // Cleanup user's resources, send notification, etc.
          await cleanupUserResources(user.id, organization.id);
        },

        // After a member is removed
        afterRemoveMember: async ({ member, user, organization }) => {
          await logMemberRemoval(user.id, organization.id);
        },

        // Before updating a member's role
        beforeUpdateMemberRole: async ({
          member,
          newRole,
          user,
          organization,
        }) => {
          // Validate role change permissions
          if (newRole === "owner" && !hasOwnerUpgradePermission(user)) {
            throw new Error("Cannot upgrade to owner role");
          }

          // Optionally modify the role
          return {
            data: {
              role: newRole,
            },
          };
        },

        // After updating a member's role
        afterUpdateMemberRole: async ({
          member,
          previousRole,
          user,
          organization,
        }) => {
          await logRoleChange(user.id, previousRole, member.role);
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

#### Invitation Hooks

Control invitation lifecycle:

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      organizationHooks: {
        // Before creating an invitation
        beforeCreateInvitation: async ({
          invitation,
          inviter,
          organization,
        }) => {
          // Custom validation or expiration logic
          const customExpiration = new Date(
            Date.now() + 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7
          ); // 7 days

          return {
            data: {
              ...invitation,
              expiresAt: customExpiration,
            },
          };
        },

        // After creating an invitation
        afterCreateInvitation: async ({
          invitation,
          inviter,
          organization,
        }) => {
          // Send custom invitation email, track metrics, etc.
          await sendCustomInvitationEmail(invitation, organization);
        },

        // Before accepting an invitation
        beforeAcceptInvitation: async ({ invitation, user, organization }) => {
          // Additional validation before acceptance
          await validateUserEligibility(user, organization);
        },

        // After accepting an invitation
        afterAcceptInvitation: async ({
          invitation,
          member,
          user,
          organization,
        }) => {
          // Setup user account, assign default resources
          await setupNewMemberResources(user, organization);
        },

        // Before/after rejecting invitations
        beforeRejectInvitation: async ({ invitation, user, organization }) => {
          // Log rejection reason, send notification to inviter
        },

        afterRejectInvitation: async ({ invitation, user, organization }) => {
          await notifyInviterOfRejection(invitation.inviterId, user.email);
        },

        // Before/after cancelling invitations
        beforeCancelInvitation: async ({
          invitation,
          cancelledBy,
          organization,
        }) => {
          // Verify cancellation permissions
        },

        afterCancelInvitation: async ({
          invitation,
          cancelledBy,
          organization,
        }) => {
          await logInvitationCancellation(invitation.id, cancelledBy.id);
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

#### Team Hooks

Control team operations (when teams are enabled):

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      teams: { enabled: true },
      organizationHooks: {
        // Before creating a team
        beforeCreateTeam: async ({ team, user, organization }) => {
          // Validate team name, apply naming conventions
          return {
            data: {
              ...team,
              name: team.name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, "-"),
            },
          };
        },

        // After creating a team
        afterCreateTeam: async ({ team, user, organization }) => {
          // Create default team resources, channels, etc.
          await createDefaultTeamResources(team.id);
        },

        // Before updating a team
        beforeUpdateTeam: async ({ team, updates, user, organization }) => {
          // Validate updates, apply business rules
          return {
            data: {
              ...updates,
              name: updates.name?.toLowerCase(),
            },
          };
        },

        // After updating a team
        afterUpdateTeam: async ({ team, user, organization }) => {
          await syncTeamChangesToExternalSystems(team);
        },

        // Before deleting a team
        beforeDeleteTeam: async ({ team, user, organization }) => {
          // Backup team data, notify members
          await backupTeamData(team.id);
        },

        // After deleting a team
        afterDeleteTeam: async ({ team, user, organization }) => {
          await cleanupTeamResources(team.id);
        },

        // Team member operations
        beforeAddTeamMember: async ({
          teamMember,
          team,
          user,
          organization,
        }) => {
          // Validate team membership limits, permissions
          const memberCount = await getTeamMemberCount(team.id);
          if (memberCount >= 10) {
            throw new Error("Team is full");
          }
        },

        afterAddTeamMember: async ({
          teamMember,
          team,
          user,
          organization,
        }) => {
          await grantTeamAccess(user.id, team.id);
        },

        beforeRemoveTeamMember: async ({
          teamMember,
          team,
          user,
          organization,
        }) => {
          // Backup user's team-specific data
          await backupTeamMemberData(user.id, team.id);
        },

        afterRemoveTeamMember: async ({
          teamMember,
          team,
          user,
          organization,
        }) => {
          await revokeTeamAccess(user.id, team.id);
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

#### Hook Error Handling

All hooks support error handling. Throwing an error in a `before` hook will prevent the operation from proceeding:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { APIError } from "better-auth/api";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      organizationHooks: {
        beforeAddMember: async ({ member, user, organization }) => {
          // Check if user has pending violations
          const violations = await checkUserViolations(user.id);
          if (violations.length > 0) {
            throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", {
              message:
                "User has pending violations and cannot join organizations",
            });
          }
        },

        beforeCreateTeam: async ({ team, user, organization }) => {
          // Validate team name uniqueness
          const existingTeam = await findTeamByName(team.name, organization.id);
          if (existingTeam) {
            throw new APIError("BAD_REQUEST", {
              message: "Team name already exists in this organization",
            });
          }
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### List User's Organizations

To list the organizations that a user is a member of, you can use `useListOrganizations` hook. It implements a reactive way to get the organizations that the user is a member of.

<Tabs items={["React", "Vue", "Svelte"]} default="React">
  <Tab value="React">
    ```tsx title="client.tsx"
    import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"

    function App(){
    const { data: organizations } = authClient.useListOrganizations()
    return (
      <div>
        {organizations.map((org) => (
          <p>{org.name}</p>
        ))}
      </div>)
    }
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Svelte">
    ```svelte title="page.svelte"
    <script lang="ts">
      import { authClient } from "$lib/auth-client";
      const organizations = authClient.useListOrganizations();
    </script>

    <h1>Organizations</h1>

    {#if $organizations.isPending}

      <p>Loading...</p>
    {:else if !$organizations.data?.length}
      <p>No organizations found.</p>
    {:else}
      <ul>
        {#each $organizations.data as organization}
          <li>{organization.name}</li>
        {/each}
      </ul>
    {/if}
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab value="Vue">
    ```vue title="organization.vue"
    <script lang="ts">;
    export default {
        setup() {
            const organizations = authClient.useListOrganizations()
            return { organizations };
        }
    };
    </script>

    <template>
        <div>
            <h1>Organizations</h1>
            <div v-if="organizations.isPending">Loading...</div>
            <div v-else-if="organizations.data === null">No organizations found.</div>
            <ul v-else>
                <li v-for="organization in organizations.data" :key="organization.id">
                    {{ organization.name }}
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </template>
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Or alternatively, you can call `organization.list` if you don't want to use a hook.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.list({});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.listOrganizations({

    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type listOrganizations = {

}
```

### Active Organization

Active organization is the workspace the user is currently working on. By default when the user is signed in the active organization is set to `null`. You can set the active organization to the user session.

<Callout type="info">
  It's not always you want to persist the active organization in the session.
  You can manage the active organization in the client side only. For example,
  multiple tabs can have different active organizations.
</Callout>

#### Set Active Organization

You can set the active organization by calling the `organization.setActive` function. It'll set the active organization for the user session.

<Callout>
  In some applications, you may want the ability to unset an active
  organization. In this case, you can call this endpoint with `organizationId`
  set to `null`.
</Callout>

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.setActive({
    organizationId: org-id, // required
    organizationSlug: org-slug, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.setActiveOrganization({
    body: {
        organizationId: org-id, // required
        organizationSlug: org-slug, // required
    }
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type setActiveOrganization = {
    /**
     * The organization ID to set as active. It can be null to unset the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string | null = "org-id"
    /**
     * The organization slug to set as active. It can be null to unset the active organization if organizationId is not provided.
     */
    organizationSlug?: string = "org-slug"

}
```

To set active organization when a session is created you can use [database hooks](/docs/concepts/database#database-hooks).

```ts title="auth.ts"
export const auth = betterAuth({
  databaseHooks: {
    session: {
      create: {
        before: async (session) => {
          const organization = await getActiveOrganization(session.userId);
          return {
            data: {
              ...session,
              activeOrganizationId: organization.id,
            },
          };
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### Use Active Organization

To retrieve the active organization for the user, you can call the `useActiveOrganization` hook. It returns the active organization for the user. Whenever the active organization changes, the hook will re-evaluate and return the new active organization.

<Tabs items={['React', 'Vue', 'Svelte']}>
  <Tab value="React">
    ```tsx title="client.tsx"
    import { authClient } from "@/lib/auth-client"

    function App(){
        const { data: activeOrganization } = authClient.useActiveOrganization()

### Get Full Organization

To get the full details of an organization, you can use the `getFullOrganization` function.
By default, if you don't pass any properties, it will use the active organization.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.getFullOrganization({
    organizationId: org-id, // required
    organizationSlug: org-slug, // required
    membersLimit, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.getFullOrganization({
    query: {
        organizationId: org-id, // required
        organizationSlug: org-slug, // required
        membersLimit, // required
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type getFullOrganization = {
    /**
     * The organization ID to get. By default, it will use the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * The organization slug to get.
     */
    organizationSlug?: string = "org-slug"
    /**
     * The limit of members to get. By default, it uses the membershipLimit option which defaults to 100.
     */
    membersLimit?: number = 100

}
```

### Update Organization

To update organization info, you can use `organization.update`

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.update({
    data,
    name: updated-name, // required
    slug: updated-slug, // required
    logo: new-logo.url, // required
    metadata, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.updateOrganization({
    body: {
        data,
        name: updated-name, // required
        slug: updated-slug, // required
        logo: new-logo.url, // required
        metadata, // required
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type updateOrganization = {
    /**
     * A partial list of data to update the organization.
     */
    data: {
        /**
         * The name of the organization.
         */
        name?: string = "updated-name"
        /**
         * The slug of the organization.
         */
        slug?: string = "updated-slug"
        /**
         * The logo of the organization.
         */
        logo?: string = "new-logo.url"
        /**
         * The metadata of the organization.
         */
        metadata?: Record<string, any> | null = { customerId: "test"
}
```

### Delete Organization

To remove user owned organization, you can use `organization.delete`

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.delete({
    organizationId: org-id,
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.deleteOrganization({
    body: {
        organizationId: org-id,
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type deleteOrganization = {
    /*
    * The organization ID to delete.
    */
    organizationId: string = "org-id"

}
```

If the user has the necessary permissions (by default: role is owner) in the specified organization, all members, invitations and organization information will be removed.

You can configure how organization deletion is handled through `organizationDeletion` option:

```ts
const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      disableOrganizationDeletion: true, //to disable it altogether
      organizationHooks: {
        beforeDeleteOrganization: async (data, request) => {
          // a callback to run before deleting org
        },
        afterDeleteOrganization: async (data, request) => {
          // a callback to run after deleting org
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Invitations

To add a member to an organization, we first need to send an invitation to the user. The user will receive an email/sms with the invitation link. Once the user accepts the invitation, they will be added to the organization.

### Setup Invitation Email

For member invitation to work we first need to provide `sendInvitationEmail` to the `better-auth` instance. This function is responsible for sending the invitation email to the user.

You'll need to construct and send the invitation link to the user. The link should include the invitation ID, which will be used with the acceptInvitation function when the user clicks on it.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { sendOrganizationInvitation } from "./email";
export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      async sendInvitationEmail(data) {
        const inviteLink = `https://example.com/accept-invitation/${data.id}`;
        sendOrganizationInvitation({
          email: data.email,
          invitedByUsername: data.inviter.user.name,
          invitedByEmail: data.inviter.user.email,
          teamName: data.organization.name,
          inviteLink,
        });
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Send Invitation

To invite users to an organization, you can use the `invite` function provided by the client. The `invite` function takes an object with the following properties:

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.inviteMember({
    email: example@gmail.com,
    role: member,
    organizationId: org-id, // required
    resend, // required
    teamId: team-id, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.createInvitation({
    body: {
        email: example@gmail.com,
        role: member,
        organizationId: org-id, // required
        resend, // required
        teamId: team-id, // required
    }
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type createInvitation = {
    /**
     * The email address of the user to invite.
     */
    email: string = "example@gmail.com"
    /**
     * The role(s) to assign to the user. It can be `admin`, `member`, or `guest`.
     */
    role: string | string[] = "member"
    /**
     * The organization ID to invite the user to. Defaults to the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "org-id"
    /**
     * Resend the invitation email, if the user is already invited.
     */
    resend?: boolean = true
    /**
     * The team ID to invite the user to.
     */
    teamId?: string = "team-id"

}
```

<Callout>
  * If the user is already a member of the organization, the invitation will be
    canceled. - If the user is already invited to the organization, unless
    `resend` is set to `true`, the invitation will not be sent again. - If
    `cancelPendingInvitationsOnReInvite` is set to `true`, the invitation will be
    canceled if the user is already invited to the organization and a new
    invitation is sent.
</Callout>

### Accept Invitation

When a user receives an invitation email, they can click on the invitation link to accept the invitation. The invitation link should include the invitation ID, which will be used to accept the invitation.

Make sure to call the `acceptInvitation` function after the user is logged in.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.acceptInvitation({
    invitationId: invitation-id,
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.acceptInvitation({
    body: {
        invitationId: invitation-id,
    }
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type acceptInvitation = {
    /**
     * The ID of the invitation to accept.
     */
    invitationId: string = "invitation-id"

}
```

#### Email Verification Requirement

If the `requireEmailVerificationOnInvitation` option is enabled in your organization configuration, users must verify their email address before they can accept invitations. This adds an extra security layer to ensure that only verified users can join your organization.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      requireEmailVerificationOnInvitation: true, // [!code highlight]
      async sendInvitationEmail(data) {
        // ... your email sending logic
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

### Invitation Accepted Callback

You can configure Better Auth to execute a callback function when an invitation is accepted. This is useful for logging events, updating analytics, sending notifications, or any other custom logic you need to run when someone joins your organization.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      async sendInvitationEmail(data) {
        // ... your invitation email logic
      },
      async onInvitationAccepted(data) {
        // This callback gets triggered when an invitation is accepted
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

The callback receives the following data:

* `id`: The invitation ID
* `role`: The role assigned to the user
* `organization`: The organization the user joined
* `invitation`: The invitation object
* `inviter`: The member who sent the invitation (including user details)
* `acceptedUser`: The user who accepted the invitation

### Cancel Invitation

If a user has sent out an invitation, you can use this method to cancel it.

If you're looking for how a user can reject an invitation, you can find that [here](#reject-invitation).

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.cancelInvitation({
    invitationId: invitation-id,
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
await auth.api.cancelInvitation({
    body: {
        invitationId: invitation-id,
    }
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type cancelInvitation = {
    /**
     * The ID of the invitation to cancel.
     */
    invitationId: string = "invitation-id"

}
```

### Reject Invitation

If this user has received an invitation, but wants to decline it, this method will allow you to do so by rejecting it.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.rejectInvitation({
    invitationId: invitation-id,
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
await auth.api.rejectInvitation({
    body: {
        invitationId: invitation-id,
    }
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type rejectInvitation = {
    /**
     * The ID of the invitation to reject.
     */
    invitationId: string = "invitation-id"

}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Like accepting invitations, rejecting invitations also requires email
  verification when the `requireEmailVerificationOnInvitation` option is
  enabled. Users with unverified emails will receive an error when attempting to
  reject invitations.
</Callout>

### Get Invitation

To get an invitation you can use the `organization.getInvitation` function provided by the client. You need to provide the invitation id as a query parameter.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.getInvitation({
    id: invitation-id,
});
```

### Server Side

```ts

        id: invitation-id,
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type getInvitation = {
    /**
     * The ID of the invitation to get.
     */
    id: string = "invitation-id"

}
```

### List Invitations

    organizationId: organization-id, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const data = await auth.api.listInvitations({
    query: {
        organizationId: organization-id, // required
    }

type listInvitations = {
    /**
     * An optional ID of the organization to list invitations for. If not provided, will default to the user's active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"

}
```

### List user invitations

To list all invitations for a given user you can use the `listUserInvitations` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const invitations = await authClient.organization.listUserInvitations();
```

On the server, you can pass the user ID as a query parameter.

```ts title="api.ts"
const invitations = await auth.api.listUserInvitations({
  query: {
    email: "user@example.com",
  },
});
```

<Callout type="warn">
  The `email` query parameter is only available on the server to query for
  invitations for a specific user.
</Callout>

    /**
     * The limit of members to return.
     */
    limit?: number = 100
    /**
     * The offset to start from.
     */
    offset?: number = 0
    /**

     */
    organizationId: string = "organization-id"

}
```

## Access Control

The organization plugin provides a very flexible access control system. You can control the access of the user based on the role they have in the organization. You can define your own set of permissions based on the role of the user.

### Roles

By default, there are three roles in the organization:

`owner`: The user who created the organization by default. The owner has full control over the organization and can perform any action.

`admin`: Users with the admin role have full control over the organization except for deleting the organization or changing the owner.

`member`: Users with the member role have limited control over the organization. They can create projects, invite users, and manage projects they have created.

<Callout>
  A user can have multiple roles. Multiple roles are stored as string separated
  by comma (",").
</Callout>

### Permissions

By default, there are three resources, and these have two to three actions.

**organization**:

`update` `delete`

**member**:

`create` `update` `delete`

**invitation**:

`create` `cancel`

The owner has full control over all the resources and actions. The admin has full control over all the resources except for deleting the organization or changing the owner. The member has no control over any of those actions other than reading the data.

### Custom Permissions

The plugin provides an easy way to define your own set of permissions for each role.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    #### Create Access Control

    You first need to create access controller by calling `createAccessControl` function and passing the statement object. The statement object should have the resource name as the key and the array of actions as the value.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    /**
     * make sure to use `as const` so typescript can infer the type correctly
     */
    const statement = { // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
    } as const; // [!code highlight]

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement); // [!code highlight]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Create Roles

    Once you have created the access controller you can create roles with the permissions you have defined.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";

    const statement = {
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
    } as const;

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

    const member = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const admin = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const owner = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]

    const myCustomRole = ac.newRole({ // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "update", "delete"], // [!code highlight]
        organization: ["update"], // [!code highlight]
    }); // [!code highlight]
    ```

    When you create custom roles for existing roles, the predefined permissions for those roles will be overridden. To add the existing permissions to the custom role, you need to import `defaultStatements` and merge it with your new statement, plus merge the roles' permissions set with the default roles.

    ```ts title="permissions.ts"
    import { createAccessControl } from "better-auth/plugins/access";
    import { defaultStatements, adminAc } from 'better-auth/plugins/organization/access'

    const statement = {
        ...defaultStatements, // [!code highlight]
        project: ["create", "share", "update", "delete"],
    } as const;

    const ac = createAccessControl(statement);

    const admin = ac.newRole({
        project: ["create", "update"],
        ...adminAc.statements, // [!code highlight]
    });
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step>
    #### Pass Roles to the Plugin

    Once you have created the roles you can pass them to the organization plugin both on the client and the server.

    ```ts title="auth.ts"
    import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
    import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"
    import { ac, owner, admin, member } from "@/auth/permissions"

    export const auth = betterAuth({
        plugins: [
            organization({
                ac,
                roles: {
                    owner,
                    admin,
                    member,
                    myCustomRole
                }
            }),
        ],
    });
    ```

    You also need to pass the access controller and the roles to the client plugin.

    ```ts title="auth-client"
    import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
    import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
    import { ac, owner, admin, member, myCustomRole } from "@/auth/permissions"

    export const authClient = createAuthClient({
        plugins: [
            organizationClient({
                ac,
                roles: {
                    owner,
                    admin,
                    member,
                    myCustomRole
                }
            })
      ]
    })
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Access Control Usage

**Has Permission**:

You can use the `hasPermission` action provided by the `api` to check the permission of the user.

```ts title="api.ts"
import { auth } from "@/auth";

await auth.api.hasPermission({
  headers: await headers(),
  body: {
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
    },
  },
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
await auth.api.hasPermission({
  headers: await headers(),
  body: {
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"], // This must match the structure in your access control
      sale: ["create"],
    },
  },
});
```

If you want to check the permission of the user on the client from the server you can use the `hasPermission` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const canCreateProject = await authClient.organization.hasPermission({
  permissions: {
    project: ["create"],
  },
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
const canCreateProjectAndCreateSale =
  await authClient.organization.hasPermission({
    permissions: {
      project: ["create"],
      sale: ["create"],
    },
  });
```

**Check Role Permission**:

Once you have defined the roles and permissions to avoid checking the permission from the server you can use the `checkRolePermission` function provided by the client.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const canCreateProject = authClient.organization.checkRolePermission({
  permissions: {
    organization: ["delete"],
  },
  role: "admin",
});

// You can also check multiple resource permissions at the same time
const canCreateProjectAndCreateSale =
  authClient.organization.checkRolePermission({
    permissions: {
      organization: ["delete"],
      member: ["delete"],
    },
    role: "admin",
  });
```

<Callout type="warn">
  This will not include any dynamic roles as everything is ran syncronously on the client side.
  Please use the [hasPermission](#access-control-usage) APIs to include checks for any dynamic roles & permissions.
</Callout>

***

## Dynamic Access Control

Dynamic access control allows you to create roles at runtime for organizations. This is achieved by storing the
created roles and permissions associated with an organization in a database table.

### Enabling Dynamic Access Control

To enable dynamic access control, pass the `dynamicAccessControl` configuration option with `enabled` set to `true` to both server and client plugins.

Ensure you have pre-defined an `ac` instance on the server auth plugin.
This is important as this is how we can infer the permissions that are available for use.

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";
import { ac } from "@/auth/permissions";

export const auth = betterAuth({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        organization({ // [!code highlight]
            ac, // Must be defined in order for dynamic access control to work // [!code highlight]
            dynamicAccessControl: { // [!code highlight]
              enabled: true, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        }) // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
```

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [ // [!code highlight]
        organizationClient({ // [!code highlight]
            dynamicAccessControl: { // [!code highlight]
              enabled: true, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
        }) // [!code highlight]
    ] // [!code highlight]
})
```

<Callout>
  This will require you to run migrations to add the new `organizationRole` table to the database.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  The `authClient.organization.checkRolePermission` function will not include any dynamic roles as everything is ran syncronously on the client side.
  Please use the [hasPermission](#access-control-usage) APIs to include checks for any dynamic roles.
</Callout>

### Creating a role

To create a new role for an organization at runtime, you can use the `createRole` function.

Only users with roles which contain the `ac` resource with the `create` permission can create a new role.
By default, only the `admin` and `owner` roles have this permission. You also cannot add permissions that your
current role in that organization can't already access.

<Callout>
  TIP: You can validate role names by using the `dynamicAccessControl.validateRoleName` option in the organization plugin config.
  Learn more [here](#validaterolename).
</Callout>

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.createRole({
    role: my-unique-role,
    permission, // required
    organizationId: organization-id, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
await auth.api.createOrgRole({
    body: {
        role: my-unique-role,
        permission, // required
        organizationId: organization-id, // required
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type createOrgRole = {
    /**
     * A unique name of the role to create.
     */
    role: string = "my-unique-role"
    /**
     * The permissions to assign to the role.
     */
    permission?: Record<string, string[]> = permission,
    /**
     * The organization ID which the role will be created in. Defaults to the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"

}
```

Now you can freely call [`updateMemberRole`](#updating-a-member-role) to update the role of a member with your newly created role!

### Deleting a role

To delete a role, you can use the `deleteRole` function, then provide either a `roleName` or `roleId` parameter along
with the `organizationId` parameter.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.deleteRole({
    roleName: my-role, // required
    roleId: role-id, // required
    organizationId: organization-id, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
await auth.api.deleteOrgRole({
    body: {
        roleName: my-role, // required
        roleId: role-id, // required
        organizationId: organization-id, // required
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type deleteOrgRole = {
    /**
     * The name of the role to delete. Alternatively, you can pass a `roleId` parameter instead.
     */
    roleName?: string = "my-role"
    /**
     * The id of the role to delete. Alternatively, you can pass a `roleName` parameter instead.
     */
    roleId?: string = "role-id"
    /**
     * The organization ID which the role will be deleted in. Defaults to the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"

}
```

### Listing roles

To list roles, you can use the `listOrgRoles` function.
This requires the `ac` resource with the `read` permission for the member to be able to list roles.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.listRoles({
    organizationId: organization-id, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const roles = await auth.api.listOrgRoles({
    query: {
        organizationId: organization-id, // required
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type listOrgRoles = {
    /**
     * The organization ID which the roles are under to list. Defaults to the user's active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"

}
```

### Getting a specific role

To get a specific role, you can use the `getOrgRole` function and pass either a `roleName` or `roleId` parameter.
This requires the `ac` resource with the `read` permission for the member to be able to get a role.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.getRole({
    roleName: my-role, // required
    roleId: role-id, // required
    organizationId: organization-id, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const role = await auth.api.getOrgRole({
    query: {
        roleName: my-role, // required
        roleId: role-id, // required
        organizationId: organization-id, // required
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type getOrgRole = {
    /**
     * The name of the role to get. Alternatively, you can pass a `roleId` parameter instead.
     */
    roleName?: string = "my-role"
    /**
     * The id of the role to get. Alternatively, you can pass a `roleName` parameter instead.
     */
    roleId?: string = "role-id"
    /**
     * The organization ID which the role will be deleted in. Defaults to the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"

}
```

### Updating a role

To update a role, you can use the `updateOrgRole` function and pass either a `roleName` or `roleId` parameter.

### Client Side

```ts
const { data, error } = await authClient.organization.updateRole({
    roleName: my-role, // required
    roleId: role-id, // required
    organizationId: organization-id, // required
    data,
    permission, // required
});
```

### Server Side

```ts
const updatedRole = await auth.api.updateOrgRole({
    body: {
        roleName: my-role, // required
        roleId: role-id, // required
        organizationId: organization-id, // required
        data,
        permission, // required
    },
    // This endpoint requires session cookies.
    headers: await headers()
});
```

### Type Definition

```ts
type updateOrgRole = {
    /**
     * The name of the role to update. Alternatively, you can pass a `roleId` parameter instead.
     */
    roleName?: string = "my-role"
    /**
     * The id of the role to update. Alternatively, you can pass a `roleName` parameter instead.
     */
    roleId?: string = "role-id"
    /**
     * The organization ID which the role will be updated in. Defaults to the active organization.
     */
    organizationId?: string = "organization-id"
    /**
     * The data which will be updated
    */
    data: {
      /**
       * Optionally update the permissions of the role.
       */
      permission?: Record<string, string[]> = { project: ["create", "update", "delete"]
}
```

### Configuration Options

Below is a list of options that can be passed to the `dynamicAccessControl` object.

#### `enabled`

This option is used to enable or disable dynamic access control. By default, it is disabled.

```ts
organization({
  dynamicAccessControl: {
    enabled: true // [!code highlight]
  }
})
```

#### `maximumRolesPerOrganization`

This option is used to limit the number of roles that can be created for an organization.

By default, the maximum number of roles that can be created for an organization is infinite.

```ts
organization({
  dynamicAccessControl: {
    maximumRolesPerOrganization: 10 // [!code highlight]
  }
})
```

You can also pass a function that returns a number.

```ts
organization({
  dynamicAccessControl: {
    maximumRolesPerOrganization: async (organizationId) => { // [!code highlight]
      const organization = await getOrganization(organizationId); // [!code highlight]
      return organization.plan === "pro" ? 100 : 10; // [!code highlight]
    } // [!code highlight]
  }
})
```

### Additional Fields

To add additional fields to the `organizationRole` table, you can pass the `additionalFields` configuration option to the `organization` plugin.

```ts
organization({
  schema: {
    organizationRole: {
      additionalFields: {
        // Role colors!
        color: {
          type: "string",
          defaultValue: "#ffffff",
        },
        //... other fields
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Then, if you don't already use `inferOrgAdditionalFields` to infer the additional fields, you can use it to infer the additional fields.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { organizationClient, inferOrgAdditionalFields } from "better-auth/client/plugins"
import type { auth } from "./auth"

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        organizationClient({
            schema: inferOrgAdditionalFields<typeof auth>()
        })
    ]
})
```

Otherwise, you can pass the schema values directly, the same way you do on the org plugin in the server.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client"
import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins"

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
    plugins: [
        organizationClient({
            schema: {
                organizationRole: {
                    additionalFields: {
                        color: {
                            type: "string",
                            defaultValue: "#ffffff",
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

***

## Teams

Teams allow you to group members within an organization. The teams feature provides additional organization structure and can be used to manage permissions at a more granular level.

### Enabling Teams

To enable teams, pass the `teams` configuration option to both server and client plugins:

```ts title="auth.ts"
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth";
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins";

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      teams: {
        enabled: true,
        maximumTeams: 10, // Optional: limit teams per organization
        allowRemovingAllTeams: false, // Optional: prevent removing the last team
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import { organizationClient } from "better-auth/client/plugins";

export const authClient = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    organizationClient({
      teams: {
        enabled: true,
      },
    }),
  ],

Teams follow the organization's permission system. To manage teams, users need the following permissions:

* `team:create` - Create new teams
* `team:update` - Update team details
* `team:delete` - Remove teams

By default:

* Organization owners and admins can manage teams
* Regular members cannot create, update, or delete teams

### Team Configuration Options

The teams feature supports several configuration options:

* `maximumTeams`: Limit the number of teams per organization

  ```ts
  teams: {
    enabled: true,
    maximumTeams: 10 // Fixed number
    // OR
    maximumTeams: async ({ organizationId, session }, request) => {
      // Dynamic limit based on organization plan
      const plan = await getPlan(organizationId)
      return plan === 'pro' ? 20 : 5
    },
    maximumMembersPerTeam: 10 // Fixed number
    // OR
    maximumMembersPerTeam: async ({ teamId, session, organizationId }, request) => {
      // Dynamic limit based on team plan
      const plan = await getPlan(organizationId, teamId)
      return plan === 'pro' ? 50 : 10
    },
  }
  ```

* `allowRemovingAllTeams`: Control whether the last team can be removed
  ```ts
  teams: {
    enabled: true,
    allowRemovingAllTeams: false // Prevent removing the last team
  }
  ```

### Team Members

When inviting members to an organization, you can specify a team:

```ts
await authClient.organization.inviteMember({
  email: "user@example.com",
  role: "member",
  teamId: "team-id",
});
```

The invited member will be added to the specified team upon accepting the invitation.

### Database Schema

When teams are enabled, new `team` and `teamMember` tables are added to the database.

Table Name: `team`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
  {
    name: "id",
    type: "string",
    description: "Unique identifier for each team",
    isPrimaryKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "name",
    type: "string",
    description: "The name of the team",
  },
  {
    name: "organizationId",
    type: "string",
    description: "The ID of the organization",
    isForeignKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "createdAt",
    type: "Date",
    description: "Timestamp of when the team was created",
  },
  {
    name: "updatedAt",
    type: "Date",
    isOptional: true,
    description: "Timestamp of when the team was created",
  },
]}
/>

Table Name: `teamMember`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
  {
    name: "id",
    type: "string",
    description: "Unique identifier for each team member",
    isPrimaryKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "teamId",
    type: "string",
    description: "Unique identifier for each team",
    isForeignKey: true,

    isForeignKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "createdAt",
    type: "Date",
    description: "Timestamp of when the team member was created",
  },
]}
/>

## Schema

The organization plugin adds the following tables to the database:

### Organization

Table Name: `organization`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
  {
    name: "id",
    type: "string",
    description: "Unique identifier for each organization",
    isPrimaryKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "name",
    type: "string",
    description: "The name of the organization",
  },
  {
    name: "slug",
    type: "string",
    description: "The slug of the organization",
  },
  {
    name: "logo",

    name: "metadata",
    type: "string",
    description: "Additional metadata for the organization",
    isOptional: true,
  },

  },
]}
/>

### Member

Table Name: `member`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
  {
    name: "id",
    type: "string",
    description: "Unique identifier for each member",
    isPrimaryKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "userId",
    type: "string",
    description: "The ID of the user",
    isForeignKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "organizationId",
    type: "string",
    description: "The ID of the organization",
    isForeignKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "role",
    type: "string",
    description: "The role of the user in the organization",
  },
  {
    name: "createdAt",
    type: "Date",
    description: "Timestamp of when the member was added to the organization",
  },
]}
/>

### Invitation

Table Name: `invitation`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
  {
    name: "id",
    type: "string",
    description: "Unique identifier for each invitation",
    isPrimaryKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "email",
    type: "string",
    description: "The email address of the user",
  },
  {
    name: "inviterId",
    type: "string",
    description: "The ID of the inviter",
    isForeignKey: true,
  },
  {

    isForeignKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "role",

  },
  {
    name: "expiresAt",
    type: "Date",
    description: "Timestamp of when the invitation expires",
  },
]}
/>

If teams are enabled, you need to add the following fields to the invitation table:

<DatabaseTable

  {
    name: "teamId",
    type: "string",
    description: "The ID of the team",
    isOptional: true,

You need to add two more fields to the session table to store the active organization ID and the active team ID.

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
  {
    name: "activeOrganizationId",

    description: "The ID of the active organization",
    isOptional: true,

    isPrimaryKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "name",
    type: "string",
    description: "The name of the team",
  },
  {
    name: "organizationId",
    type: "string",
    description: "The ID of the organization",
    isForeignKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "createdAt",
    type: "Date",
    description: "Timestamp of when the team was created",
  },
  {
    name: "updatedAt",
    type: "Date",
    isOptional: true,
    description: "Timestamp of when the team was created",
  },
]}
/>

Table Name: `teamMember`

<DatabaseTable
  fields={[
  {
    name: "id",

  },
  {
    name: "teamId",
    type: "string",
    description: "Unique identifier for each team",
    isForeignKey: true,
  },
  {
    name: "userId",
    type: "string",

  fields={[
  {
    name: "teamId",
    type: "string",
    description: "The ID of the team",
    isOptional: true,
  },
]}
/>

### Customizing the Schema

To change the schema table name or fields, you can pass `schema` option to the organization plugin.

```ts title="auth.ts"
const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      schema: {
        organization: {
          modelName: "organizations", //map the organization table to organizations
          fields: {
            name: "title", //map the name field to title
          },
          additionalFields: {
            // Add a new field to the organization table
            myCustomField: {
              type: "string",
              input: true,
              required: false,
            },
          },
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

#### Additional Fields

Starting with [Better Auth v1.3](https://github.com/better-auth/better-auth/releases/tag/v1.3.0), you can easily add custom fields to the `organization`, `invitation`, `member`, and `team` tables.

When you add extra fields to a model, the relevant API endpoints will automatically accept and return these new properties. For instance, if you add a custom field to the `organization` table, the `createOrganization` endpoint will include this field in its request and response payloads as needed.

```ts title="auth.ts"
const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      schema: {
        organization: {
          additionalFields: {
            myCustomField: {
              // [!code highlight]
              type: "string", // [!code highlight]
              input: true, // [!code highlight]
              required: false, // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
          },
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

For inferring the additional fields, you can use the `inferOrgAdditionalFields` function. This function will infer the additional fields from the auth object type.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
import { createAuthClient } from "better-auth/client";
import {
  inferOrgAdditionalFields,
  organizationClient,
} from "better-auth/client/plugins";
import type { auth } from "@/auth"; // import the auth object type only

const client = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    organizationClient({
      schema: inferOrgAdditionalFields<typeof auth>(),
    }),
  ],
});
```

if you can't import the auth object type, you can use the `inferOrgAdditionalFields` function without the generic. This function will infer the additional fields from the schema object.

```ts title="auth-client.ts"
const client = createAuthClient({
  plugins: [
    organizationClient({
      schema: inferOrgAdditionalFields({
        organization: {
          // [!code highlight]
          additionalFields: {
            newField: {
              // [!code highlight]
              type: "string", // [!code highlight]
            }, // [!code highlight]
          },
        },
      }),
    }),
  ],
});

//example usage
await client.organization.create({
  name: "Test",
  slug: "test",
  newField: "123", //this should be allowed
  //@ts-expect-error - this field is not available
  unavalibleField: "123", //this should be not allowed
});
```
