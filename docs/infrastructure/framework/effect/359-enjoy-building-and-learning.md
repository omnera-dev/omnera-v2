## Enjoy Building and Learning

Learning Effect is a lot of fun. Many developers in the Effect ecosystem are using Effect to solve real problems in their day-to-day work, and also experiment with cutting edge ideas for pushing TypeScript to be the most useful language it can be.

You don't have to use all aspects of Effect at once, and can start with the pieces of the ecosystem that make the most sense for the problems you are solving. Effect is a toolkit, and you can pick and choose the pieces that make the most sense for your use case. However, as more and more of your codebase is using Effect, you will probably find yourself wanting to utilize more of the ecosystem!

Effect's concepts may be new to you, and might not completely make sense at first. This is totally normal. Take your time with reading the docs and try to understand the core concepts - this will really pay off later on as you get into the more advanced tooling in the Effect ecosystem. The Effect community is always happy to help you learn and grow. Feel free to hop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) or discuss on [GitHub](https://github.com/Effect-TS)! We are open to feedback and contributions, and are always looking for ways to improve Effect.
