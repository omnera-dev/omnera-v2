## Overview

In this guide, we will explore the concept of **branded types** in TypeScript and learn how to create and work with them using the Brand module.
Branded types are TypeScript types with an added type tag that helps prevent accidental usage of a value in the wrong context.
They allow us to create distinct types based on an existing underlying type, enabling type safety and better code organization.
