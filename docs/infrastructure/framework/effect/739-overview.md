## Overview

The `Hash` interface is closely tied to the [Equal](/docs/trait/equal/) interface and serves a supportive role in optimizing equality checks by providing a mechanism for hashing. Hashing is an important step in the efficient determination of equality between two values, particularly when used with data structures like hash tables.
