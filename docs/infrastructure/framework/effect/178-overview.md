import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"

In the Effect module, similar to other modules like [Option](/docs/data-types/option/#pattern-matching) and [Exit](/docs/data-types/exit/#pattern-matching), we have a `Effect.match` function that allows us to handle different cases simultaneously.
Additionally, Effect provides various functions to manage both success and failure scenarios in effectful programs.
