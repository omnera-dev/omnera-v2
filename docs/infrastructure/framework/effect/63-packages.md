## Packages

Effectâ€™s AI ecosystem is composed of several focused packages:

### `@effect/ai`

Defines the core abstractions for interacting with LLM provider services. This package defines the generic services and helper utilities needed to build AI-powered applications in a provider-agnostic way.

Use this package to:
