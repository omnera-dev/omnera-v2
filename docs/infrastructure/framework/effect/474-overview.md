In the context of programming, a **service** refers to a reusable component or functionality that can be used by different parts of an application.
Services are designed to provide specific capabilities and can be shared across multiple modules or components.

Services often encapsulate common tasks or operations that are needed by different parts of an application.
They can handle complex operations, interact with external systems or APIs, manage data, or perform other specialized tasks.

Services are typically designed to be modular and decoupled from the rest of the application.
This allows them to be easily maintained, tested, and replaced without affecting the overall functionality of the application.

When diving into services and their integration in application development, it helps to start from the basic principles of function management and dependency handling without relying on advanced constructs. Imagine having to manually pass a service around to every function that needs it:

```ts showLineNumbers=false
const processData = (data: Data, databaseService: DatabaseService) => {
  // Operations using the database service
}
```

This approach becomes cumbersome and unmanageable as your application grows, with services needing to be passed through multiple layers of functions.

To streamline this, you might consider using an environment object that bundles various services:

```ts showLineNumbers=false
type Context = {
  databaseService: DatabaseService
  loggingService: LoggingService
}

const processData = (data: Data, context: Context) => {
  // Using multiple services from the context
}
```

However, this introduces a new complexity: you must ensure that the environment is correctly set up with all necessary services before it's used, which can lead to tightly coupled code and makes functional composition and testing more difficult.
