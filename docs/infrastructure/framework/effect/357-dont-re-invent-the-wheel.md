## Don't Re-Invent the Wheel

Application code in TypeScript often solves the same problems over and over again. Interacting with external services, filesystems, databases, etc. are common problems for all application developers. Effect provides a rich ecosystem of libraries that provide standardized solutions to many of these problems. You can use these libraries to build your application, or you can use them to build your own libraries.

Managing challenges like error handling, debugging, tracing, async/promises, retries, streaming, concurrency, caching, resource management, and a lot more are made manageable with Effect. You don't have to re-invent the solutions to these problems, or install tons of dependencies. Effect, under one umbrella, solves many of the problems that you would usually install many different dependencies with different APIs to solve.
