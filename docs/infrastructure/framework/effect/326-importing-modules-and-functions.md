## Importing Modules and Functions

Once you have installed the `effect` package, you can start using its modules and functions in your projects.
Importing modules and functions is straightforward and follows the standard JavaScript/TypeScript import syntax.

To import a module or a function from the `effect` package, simply use the `import` statement at the top of your file. Here's how you can import the `Effect` module:

```ts showLineNumbers=false
import { Effect } from 'effect'
```

Now, you have access to the Effect module, which is the heart of the Effect library. It provides various functions to create, compose, and manipulate effectful computations.
