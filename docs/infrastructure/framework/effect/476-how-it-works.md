## How It Works

Up to this point, our examples with the Effect framework have dealt with effects that operate independently of external services.
This means the `Requirements` parameter in our `Effect` type signature has been set to `never`, indicating no dependencies.

However, real-world applications often need effects that rely on specific services to function correctly. These services are managed and accessed through a construct known as `Context`.

The `Context` serves as a repository or container for all services an effect may require.
It acts like a store that maintains these services, allowing various parts of your application to access and use them as needed.

The services stored within the `Context` are directly reflected in the `Requirements` parameter of the `Effect` type.
Each service within the `Context` is identified by a unique "tag," which is essentially a unique identifier for the service.

When an effect needs to use a specific service, the service's tag is included in the `Requirements` type parameter.
