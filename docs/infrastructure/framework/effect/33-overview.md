When working with error handling in TypeScript, both [neverthrow](https://github.com/supermacro/neverthrow) and Effect provide useful abstractions for modeling
success and failure without exceptions. They share many concepts, such as wrapping computations in a safe container,
transforming values with `map`, handling errors with `mapErr`/`mapLeft`, and offering utilities to combine or unwrap results.

This page shows a side-by-side comparison of neverthrow and Effect APIs for common use cases.
If you're already familiar with neverthrow, the examples will help you understand how to achieve the same patterns with Effect.
If you're starting fresh, the comparison highlights the similarities and differences so you can decide which library better fits your project.

neverthrow exposes **instance methods** (for example, `result.map(...)`).
Effect exposes **functions** on `Either` (for example, `Either.map(result, ...)`) and supports a `pipe` style for readability and better tree shaking.
