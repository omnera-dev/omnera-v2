## Overview

In many applications, handling overlapping work is common. For example, in services that process incoming requests, it's important to avoid redundant work like handling the same request multiple times. The Cache module helps improve performance by preventing duplicate work.

Key Features of Cache:

| Feature                           | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Compositionality**              | Allows overlapping work across different parts of the application while preserving compositional programming.          |
| **Unified Sync and Async Caches** | Integrates both synchronous and asynchronous caches through a unified lookup function that computes values either way. |
| **Effect Integration**            | Works natively with the Effect library, supporting concurrent lookups, failure handling, and interruption.             |
| **Cache Metrics**                 | Tracks key metrics like entries, hits, and misses, providing insights for performance optimization.                    |
