## Overview

In long-running applications, managing resources efficiently is essential, particularly when building large-scale systems. If resources like socket connections, database connections, or file descriptors are not properly managed, it can lead to resource leaks, which degrade application performance and reliability. Effect provides constructs that help ensure resources are properly managed and released, even in cases where exceptions occur.

By ensuring that every time a resource is acquired, there is a corresponding mechanism to release it, Effect simplifies the process of resource management in your application.
