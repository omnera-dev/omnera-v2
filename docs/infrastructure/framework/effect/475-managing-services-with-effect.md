## Managing Services with Effect

The Effect library simplifies managing these dependencies by leveraging the type system.
Instead of manually passing services or environment objects around, Effect allows you to declare service dependencies directly in the function's type signature using the `Requirements` parameter in the `Effect` type:

```ts showLineNumbers=false "Requirements"
                         ┌─── Represents required dependencies
                         ▼
Effect<Success, Error, Requirements>
```

This is how it works in practice when using Effect:

**Dependency Declaration**: You specify what services a function needs directly in its type, pushing the complexity of dependency management into the type system.

**Service Provision**: `Effect.provideService` is used to make a service implementation available to the functions that need it. By providing services at the start, you ensure that all parts of your application have consistent access to the required services, thus maintaining a clean and decoupled architecture.

This approach abstracts away manual service handling, letting developers focus on business logic while the compiler ensures all dependencies are correctly managed. It also makes code more maintainable and scalable.

Let's walk through managing services in Effect step by step:

1. **Creating a Service**: Define a service with its unique functionality and interface.
2. **Using the Service**: Access and utilize the service within your application’s functions.
3. **Providing a Service Implementation**: Supply an actual implementation of the service to fulfill the declared requirements.
