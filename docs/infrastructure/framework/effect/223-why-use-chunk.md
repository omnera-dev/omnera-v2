## Why Use Chunk?

- **Immutability**: Unlike standard JavaScript arrays, which are mutable, `Chunk` provides a truly immutable collection, preventing data from being modified after creation. This is especially useful in concurrent programming contexts where immutability can enhance data consistency.

- **High Performance**: `Chunk` supports specialized operations for efficient array manipulation, such as appending single elements or concatenating chunks, making these operations faster than their regular JavaScript array equivalents.
