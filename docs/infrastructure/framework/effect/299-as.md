## as

Replaces the value inside an effect with a constant value.

`Effect.as` allows you to ignore the original value inside an effect and replace it with a new constant value.

<Aside type="note" title="Effects are Immutable">
  It's important to note that effects are immutable, meaning that the
  original effect is not modified. Instead, a new effect is returned with
  the updated value.

**Example** (Replacing a Value)

```ts twoslash
import { pipe, Effect } from "effect"

// Replace the value 5 with the constant "new value"
const program = pipe(Effect.succeed(5), Effect.as("new value"))

Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log) // Output: "new value"
```
