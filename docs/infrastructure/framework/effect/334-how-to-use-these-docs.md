## How to Use These Docs

The documentation is structured in a sequential manner, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics. This allows you to follow along step-by-step as you build your Effect application. However, you have the flexibility to read the documentation in any order or jump directly to the pages that are relevant to your specific use case.

To facilitate navigation within a page, you will find a table of contents on the right side of the screen. This allows you to easily jump between different sections of the page.

### Docs for LLMs

We support the [llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) convention for making documentation available to large language models and the applications that make use of them.

Currently, we have the following root-level files:

- [/llms.txt](https://effect.website/llms.txt) — a listing of the available files
- [/llms-full.txt](https://effect.website/llms-full.txt) — complete documentation for Effect
- [/llms-small.txt](https://effect.website/llms-small.txt) — compressed documentation for use with smaller context windows
