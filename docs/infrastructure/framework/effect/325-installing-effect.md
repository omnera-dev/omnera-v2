## Installing Effect

If you haven't already installed the `effect` package, you can do so by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs syncKey="package-manager">

<TabItem label="npm" icon="seti:npm">

```sh showLineNumbers=false
npm install effect
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="pnpm" icon="pnpm">

```sh showLineNumbers=false
pnpm add effect
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Yarn" icon="seti:yarn">

```sh showLineNumbers=false
yarn add effect
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Bun" icon="bun">

```sh showLineNumbers=false
bun add effect
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Deno" icon="deno">

```sh showLineNumbers=false
deno add npm:effect
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

By installing this package, you get access to the core functionality of Effect.

For detailed installation instructions for platforms like Deno or Bun, refer to the [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation/) guide, which provides step-by-step guidance.

You can also start a new Effect app using [`create-effect-app`](/docs/getting-started/create-effect-app/), which automatically sets up everything for you.
