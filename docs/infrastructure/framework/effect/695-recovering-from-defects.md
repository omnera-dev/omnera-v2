## Recovering from Defects

When working with streams, it's essential to be prepared for various failure scenarios, including defects that might occur during stream processing. To address this, the `Stream.catchAllCause` function provides a robust solution. It enables you to gracefully handle and recover from any type of failure that may arise.

**Example**

```ts twoslash
import { Stream, Effect } from 'effect'

const s1 = Stream.make(1, 2, 3).pipe(
  Stream.concat(Stream.dieMessage('Boom!')),
  Stream.concat(Stream.make(4, 5))
)

const s2 = Stream.make('a', 'b', 'c')

const stream = Stream.catchAllCause(s1, () => s2)

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(stream)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ 1, 2, 3, "a", "b", "c" ]
}
*/
```

In this example, `s1` may encounter a defect, but instead of crashing the application, we use `Stream.catchAllCause` to gracefully switch to an alternative stream, `s2`. This ensures that your application remains robust and continues processing data even in the face of unexpected issues.
