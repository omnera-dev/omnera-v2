## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful, inclusive, and collaborative environment. We expect all contributors to:

- Be respectful and constructive in communication
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what's best for the project and community

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) v1.3.0 or higher
- Git
- A GitHub account

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/omnera-v2.git
   cd omnera-v2
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/omnera-dev/omnera-v2.git
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```
5. **Verify your setup**:
   ```bash
   bun run lint && bun run typecheck && bun test:unit
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### Making Changes

1. **Follow coding standards** - See [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for detailed guidelines:
   - No semicolons (Prettier enforced)
   - Single quotes
   - 100 character line width
   - TypeScript strict mode
   - Functional programming patterns (ESLint enforced)

2. **Write tests**:
   - Unit tests: Co-located with source files (`*.test.ts`)
   - E2E tests: In `tests/` directory (`*.spec.ts`)
   - Aim for high coverage of new code

3. **Keep commits focused** - One logical change per commit

### Running Quality Checks

Before committing, always run:

```bash
# Run all checks
bun run lint && bun run format && bun run typecheck && bun test:unit

# Or individually
bun run lint          # ESLint
bun run format        # Prettier formatting
bun run typecheck     # TypeScript type checking
bun test:unit         # Unit tests
bun test:e2e          # E2E tests
```

## Commit Guidelines

We use **[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** for automated versioning and changelog generation.
